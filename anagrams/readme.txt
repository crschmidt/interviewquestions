This is taken from Yelp's Glassdoor interview questions.

# given a list of words, write a function which
# takes in the list, and groups the words together
# according to which ones are anagrams of eachother
# e.g.
# input = ["art", "rat", "bats", "banana", "stab", "tar"]
# output = [["art", "rat", "tar], ["bats", "stab"], ["banana"]]
