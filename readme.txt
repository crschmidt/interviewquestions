Stashing some of the interview questions I've dealt with, and representing
my thought process and answers to them to the best of my ability.

In each folder is a readme.txt describing the prompt, and some questions
that were brought up; a solution.py, which is the best representation
I can make of the *actual code* I wrote on the whiteboard, warts and 
all, and a test file that I wrote to demonstrate the behavior of
the solutions I coded.
