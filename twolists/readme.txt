 1. Given two sorted lists, produce the intersection of the list.
 2. Now don't include duplicates.

Some questions that come up in this process:

 1. What is the worst case computational time of your algorithm?
 2. What is the additional memory requirement of your algorithm (beyond
    the provided lists)
